# Xylitol

Newer Android devices have mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from powering off the device. However, older devices did not always have these preventative measures. Powering off a device prevents it from being pinged, wiped, or located.

Xylitol is an app designed to imitate the valid shutdown sequence of a OnePlus One device in the event of a phone confiscation so that the phone can be located and recovered by the owner.
